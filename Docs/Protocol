Physical protocol uses power line voltages to 

Control Device (RPi)
* Controls voltage on line to either 12, 10, or 8 V
* On startup signals 8V for 3 seconds, 10V for 1 second and then provides 12V
* Sends information using voltage
* Recieves information using current

Remote device (Microcontroller)
* Controls current draw by adding 50mA
* Recieves information using voltage
  * Voltages set using control device startup procedure
  * This accounts for line voltage drop
* Sends information using current

Control Device Transmission
* Voltage drops to 10V for 20ms to clear any remote device transmission requests
* Voltage drops to 8V signalling begining of transmission
* 8V signals logic low, 10V signals logic high
* first bit begins 10ms after first transition to 8V
* Message is 32 bits -- 8 bit address, 8 bit command, 16-bit argument
* Message end signaled by transition to 12V

Remote device recieving
* Power line voltage is monitored
* First bit recorded 15ms after transition to 8V
* Follow on bits are recored 10ms after the previous one

Remote Device Transmission
* MOSFET used to draw additional 50 mA current
* MOSFET cycled every 5ms until power line voltage drops to 8V
* MOSFET cycled three times at 10ms intervals after drop is detected
* MOSFET on is logic high, MOSFET off is logic low
* First bit is transitioned to 10 ms after third 10ms cycle (40 ms after 8V drop is detected)
* Message is 32 bits -- 8 bit address, 8 bit message identifier, and 16 bit argument

Control Device Receiving
* Current draw is sensed
* Running average is kept
* short variations (less than 20 ms) from running average are assmed to be signals
* First bit recorded 15 ms after third 10ms cycle is detected
* Follow on bits are recorded 10 ms after the previous one
